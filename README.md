# Password-Strength-Test-Fall21

For my final project, I will create a flask web page that allows you to input any password and check if the password is secure enough. After inputting your password, a generated score will be provided. From 0 to 100, 100 being the best and most secure password. If the password's score is less than 75%, it will recommend what they should add to their password to strengthen it (e.g., adding special characters, numbers, and mixed-case letters).

I believe that this project will be beneficial for both personal and business use. We use passwords every day, and passwords are the only things protecting our sensitive information. Every day, companies are facing cyberattacks for personal information. Keeping a solid secure password can help keep your information safe from these attacks.
